# POTHOLE DETECTION FRAMEWORK

## Problem Statement

### Imagine that the Government have resources to have drones deployed to survey roads on a regular basis. The pictures captured by these drones will have to be sent to a central data repository, where using computer vision, the system will identify potholes that need immediate attention and send a trigger to the Executive Engineer of the respective district, Chief Engineer of PWD Kerala and the Minister of PWD. The solution should also be able to prioritize the need of attention that is required. . The challenge for the participants is twofold. (a) Develop an Al algorithm which can detect potholes from drone pictures of roads. They should be able to generate training and test data for this themselves. (6) Design a data architecture to implement this solution, assuming the Government will have readily deployable drones.

## Solution

1. ### Data acquisition and preparation
2. ### Model training and evaluation
3. ### Model deployment for realtime detection
4. ### Notifying the authorities

## 1. Data acquisition and preparation
### Pothole data/images taken from Kaggle and used 3D software to rotate and multiply images

### Fine tuned the model using Teachable Machine framework, a Conolutional Neural Network model was used considering its efficiency in Image Classification.

- Epoch: 50
- Batch size: 16
- Training rate: 0.001
